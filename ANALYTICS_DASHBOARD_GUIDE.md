## Technical Implementation

### Backend Analytics Engine

#### Data Aggregation
```javascript
// Daily upload trends using MongoDB aggregation
const dailyUploads = await Document.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      uploadDate: { $gte: thirtyDaysAgo }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {
        year: { $year: '$uploadDate' },
        month: { $month: '$uploadDate' },
        day: { $dayOfMonth: '$uploadDate' }
      },
      count: { $sum: 1 },
      totalSize: { $sum: '$fileSize' }
    }
  }
]);
```

#### Key API Endpoints
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` - Complete admin analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/user-stats` - Personal user statistics

### Frontend Visualization

#### Chart.js Integration

### Database Optimization

#### Indexes for Performance
```javascript
// Optimized indexes for analytics queries
db.documents.createIndex({ "uploadDate": 1 });
db.recents.createIndex({ "timestamp": 1, "user": 1 });
db.documents.createIndex({ "uploader": 1 });
```
